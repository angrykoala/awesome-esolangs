# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Use the following format: `[language|resource](link) - Description.`
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Additions should be added in alphabetical order of the relevant category.
